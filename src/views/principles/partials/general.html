## Voice

Voice is the foundation for communicating Bluemix's product and brand message. It expresses the core of our personality, while bringing comfort, ease, and a sense of connection to our users. Be consistent with voice across the platform.

## Tone

**It's not what you say, it's how you say it.**

Tone is used to ehance voice. It expresses mood and dictates how something is read. Tone should be dynamic, and adapt depending on the situation. Choose the tone that will best fit your audience, context, and their conditions. For example, getting started or onboarding content may be more lighthearted, while error messages should be more direct and distinct.
