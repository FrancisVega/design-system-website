        IBM Design says, "focus on the user."
        <br><br>
        Front end development bridges design and engineering, bringing content to reality and making products valuable for users. - IBM Design Language
        <br><br>
        But, this also includes the engineers and front-end developers you work with - they are also users because we all share and rely on each other's code to build products for our end-users.
