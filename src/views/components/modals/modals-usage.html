## General

- Modals should not contain scrolling content
- If your modal contains informational content only, consider using a <a href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/components/notifications.html">Notification</a> instead.

### Dismissal

Modals can be dismissed in 3 ways:

- Using the &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the upper right hand corner of the modal
- Pressing the <code>ESC</code> key
- Clicking / touching outside of the modal area

## Structure

### Header
Include a heading within the modal that mirrors the action or button that was clicked by the user. Headers include a close button (&ldquo;x&rdquo;) in the upper right hand corner of the modal.

### Body
The body content within a modal should be as minimal as possible. Some base elements that can be used in modals are: form fields, text area, select, and radio buttons.

### Footer
The footer area of a modal typically contains a set of buttons. Refer to <a href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/base-elements/buttons.html">button</a> guidelines for usage.

## Examples

### Transactional Modals

Typically, the modal requests either a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; response from the user. Use when secondary confirmation is needed.

</div>

### Input Modal
Modals used in this case should include areas for input that the user can interact with. These can include but are not limited to: forms, dropdowns, selectors, and links.
