## General

### Text

Limit dropdown content to a single line of text that describes the action it will perform when selected. Do not use multiple lines of text, images, or icons within a dropdown. Sort the items in logical order, such as grouping related options together.

### Length

Keep dropdown options succinct. Long dropdowns that require scrolling make it difficult for users to see all their options in one glance.

## Interaction

Dropdowns should appear on `click` rather than on `hover.` Hover-activated dropdowns increase cognitive load on users and are not recommended due to usability issues. Dropdowns should appear above all other elements within the UI. They can be dismissed by clicking outside of the dropdown item or on the parent element. Selecting an item from the dropdown will also dismiss it.

## Usage

### Small dropdown

Small dropdowns are commonly used in <a class="base-link" href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/components/tables.html#foundation" target="_blank">Tables.</a> When using a small dropdown for a number selection, the increments in the dropdown should be 10, 25, 50 and 100. The maximum amount of items a user can see per page is 100.

### Dropdown as a filter

A dropdown may be used to filter a set of data.

<div class="overlay-image">
  <img class="thumbnail-img" src="/assets/images/usage/components/dropdown.png" />
  <a href="/assets/images/usage/components/dropdown.png" target="_blank" class="overlay">
    <img src="/assets/images/icons/ibm-eye.png" />
    <p>View at 100%</p>
  </a>
</div>
