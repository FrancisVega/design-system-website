## General

### Text

The text within an overflow menu should be direct so users can quickly decide on an action.  Actions that could cause a significant change to the user's data (Delete app, Delete Service, etc.) is separated by a horizontal rule and live below the primary set of actions.

<p class="caption">Example:</h5>
<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/overflow-cards.png" />
</div>

### Positioning

Depending on where the overflow menu appears within the UI, the caret or arrow may be left or right aligned so the overflow menu is clearly visible.

<p class="caption">Left-aligned overflow menu:</h5>
<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/overflow-menu-left.png" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Right-aligned overflow menu:</h5>
<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/overflow-menu-right.png" />
</div>


## Usage

### Overflow menu in Detail Page Header

<p class="caption">Example:</h5>

### Overflow menu in Cards

Due to space constraints, it is difficult to show all available actions that manipulate an object within a card. An overflow menu may be used to present additional menu options that directly relate to the card.

<p class="caption">Example:</h5>
<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/overflow-cards-2.png" />
</div>
