  <p class="item-section__desc">The Content Switcher is used for large groups of content, as opposed to the <a href="../base-elements/toggles.html">Toggle</a>, which is meant for a "yes"/"no" or "on"/"off" binary decision.
An example situation for a Content Switcher is in the case of a form in which some of the fields are dependent on the selected option of a prior field.</p>

    <li>There should be a default selection based on usage. This would be the first option.</li>
    <li>No more than two words may be used for any title.</li>
    <li>It is recommended to keep Content Switchers to binary selection. However, three to five options may be used given the circumstances. Discretion should be exercised when using more than two options.</li>
