## Structure
Cards can be as minimal as a title, icon and description, or as detailed as including a title, chart, live metrics, and several pieces of metadata.

### Icon Usage
Icons are commonly used in cards to give context to the content at a quick glance.

### Title
Titles provide meaning to the data that the card is displaying.

### Description
The card's description section lives just below the title, and can be used to provide additional information (IP address, URL, instance name).

### Footer
The footer is commonly used for interactive elements, which can be any of the following: secondary buttons, links, and action icons. It can also contain additional informational content, such as plan name or app status.

### Overflow Menu
An overflow menu is a common pattern used within cards. It is used to present additional menu options that directly relate to the card. For more usage guidelines, see <a href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/components/overflow-menu.html"> Overflow Menu.</a>
