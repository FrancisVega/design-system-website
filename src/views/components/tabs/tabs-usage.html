## General

### Text
Each tab title describes its content and sets user expectations. Titles are concise and use one to two words maximum. Keep in mind that at mobile widths, the character length of a title will impact the experience.

Icons are not permitted in the tab titles.

### Number of Tabs
A maximum of six tabs may be displayed. This is to maintain an uncluttered UI and reduce cognitive load for users.

### Order
Tab order should be consistent across service instances. Tabs with related content should be grouped adjacent to each other.
<!--
### Secondary Level
Tabs are used to quickly navigate between views within the same context. This is to ensure a consistent, simple, and easily navigable experience for users. Intuitive taxonomy and descriptive tab titles can go a long way towards creating a good user experience.

Secondary level tabs are used when displaying multiple sets or views of the same content, or when switching between discrete but related content. The secondary level tabs changes the view or content within its parent tab, and should look and feel as shown below:

<div class="overlay-image">
<img class="thumbnail-img" src="/assets/images/usage/tabs-secondary-level.png" />
<a href="/assets/images/usage/tabs-secondary-level.png" target="_blank" class="overlay">
<img src="/assets/images/icons/ibm-eye.png" />
<p>View at 100%</p>
</a>
</div>-->

## Standard Use Cases

Tabs are used within the <a class="base-link" href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/templates/instance-dashboards.html" target="_blank"> Service Dashboard.</a>

### Manage
The Manage tab contains learning content and additional information that aids in productive use.

### Service Credentials
The service credentials tab shows the service instance credentials to an end user. Currently, users have the ability to create mulitple sets of credentials. Services that do not use credentials will not be required to have this tab.

### Connections
This tab provides a way for users to bind their service instance to an existing app or service instance. Service to service bindings will be supported in the near future.

### Getting Started
Get Started is defined as the bare-minimum set of usage instructions an end-user needs to get up and running. Getting started content may manifest itself in different ways across the platform. Instill user confidence by presenting the quickest path to success.

**Use Case**
Get Started at the instance level provides content to help a user to get up and running as fast as possible. At this level, getting started content manifests itself in the <a class="base-link" href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/templates/instance-dashboards.html" target="_blank">Instance Dashboard</a> under the Getting Started tab. Upon creation of a service instance, the content on the Getting Started tab is the first thing users encounter and will likely dictate how successful they are with the service.

**Implementation**
Service providers should have consistent getting started documentation using the <a class="base-link" href="https://releaseblueprints.ibm.com/display/CLOUDOE/getting+started+template+and+guidelines" target="_blank">Bluemix Getting Started Template and Guidelines.</a> Content on the Getting Started tab is populated directly from Bluemix Documentation once service providers register their service.

**Example**
<div class="overlay-image">
<img class="thumbnail-img" src="/assets/images/usage/components/tabs.png" />
<a href="/assets/images/usage/components/tabs.png" target="_blank" class="overlay">
<img src="/assets/images/icons/ibm-eye.png" />
<p>View at 100%</p>
</a>
</div>
<!--
### Custom Tabs
Some services require additional functionality that is not currently supported by the default tabs. Service providers who validate a need for an additional tab are permited one custom tab. -->
