{{#markdown}}

### Text
Be concise and specific. Titles may have at most two words.

### Default Selection
Based on usage, there should be a default selection. The default selection is always the first option in a switcher.

### Example
The Content Switcher is used for large groups of content, as opposed to the <a href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/base-elements/toggles.html" target="_blank">Toggle</a> which is meant for a &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; or &ldquo;On/Off&rdquo; binary decision.
