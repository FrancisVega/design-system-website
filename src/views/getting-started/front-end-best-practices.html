## Maintainability

IBM Design says, "focus on the user."

Front end development bridges design and engineering, bringing content to reality and making products valuable for users. - IBM Design Language

This also includes the engineers and front-end developers you work with &mdash; they are also users because we all share and rely on each other's code to build products for our end-users.

Writing maintainable code ensures that we continuously fulfill our responsibilities of making essential, delightful products for our end-users.

- Write readable and well-named code
- Write code that's well-documented
- Write testable code
