#### 3. Using the Design Kit
The Bluemix Design Kit contains core visual styles, components and elements, and templates. It contains a collection of symbols and text styles for rapid design and prototyping of layouts for the Bluemix platform. Each are broken out into respective pages, which can be navigated to through the left side panel.

### Light and Dark UI
Light UI is a theme weâ€™ve developed for Bluemix to cater to those users who either prefer light UI or are entering Bluemix from SoftLayer, which is currently light. Each component and element was designed with a light and a dark theme.
