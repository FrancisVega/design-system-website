### 3. Using the Design Kit
The Design Kit contains core visual styles, components and elements, and templates. It contains a collection of symbols and text styles for rapid design and prototyping of layouts. Each is broken out into respective pages, which can be navigated to through the left side panel.

### Light and Dark UI
Light UI is a theme weâ€™ve developed to cater to those users who either prefer light UI. Each component was designed with a light and a dark theme.
