  <span class="blue-30">Bluemix Components</span> gives developers (FEDs & Engineers) a collection of re-usable HTML and Sass partials they can use for building websites and user-interfaces for Bluemix. The aim is for every developer to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in their prototype and production work.
</p>


## Installing
There are a few ways to get started. Before installing Bluemix Components, make sure you set up your <a class="base-link" href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key"/>SSH key on GitHub Enterprise.</a> You may also need to set up your SSH key on **Jenkins** or **Travis** if you use those for continuous integration or deployment.


### NPM
Bluemix Components is published to a private npm registry maintained by Bluemix Ops Console team.

Before installing with npm, you must create an **.npmrc** file - you can create this in the root of your project folder or on your computer's ~ directory.

```html
$ touch .npmrc
```

<br>
Next, write the following into your **.npmrc** file:

```html
//dev-console-npm.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/:_authToken="u6vjQywpRv51/eKBiRcAFA=="
@console:registry=https://dev-console-npm.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/
```

<br>
If you haven't done so already, create a **package.json** for your project:

```html
$ npm init
```

<br>
Finally, install bluemix components with `npm`.

```html
$ npm install @console/bluemix-components --save
```

### Bower

We also publish Bluemix Components to a private bower registry.
It's required to set up your [SSH Key on GitHub Enterprise](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) and on **Jenkins** or **Travis** if you use those as well.


Create a **bower.json** file:

```json
$ bower init
```
<br>
Create a **.bowerrc** file in the root of your project directory and write the following config:

```json
{ "registry": "http://9.37.228.216:5678/" }
```

<br>
Finally, install the bower package.

```json
$ bower install bluemix-components --save
```
