### Labels
Effective form labeling helps users understand what information to enter into a text field. Using a placeholder (hint text) as a label is often applied as a space-saving method. However, this is not recommended because it hides context and presents accessibility issues. Hint text also increases cognitive load since users are forced to remember a label even after its filled out.

Accessibility best practices include:

- Labels must be visible when a field gets focus.
- Labels must be announced to the screen reader on focus.
- Ensure the helper text that appears under a field is read when an assistive technology user stops at a field using ARIA.
- Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized).


### Default values
Where possible, add programmatic assistance. Detect and pre-fill fields to reduce errors and save time. When the software can't determine the value that belongs in a field, use type-ahead to make suggestions. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) for default values, detected values, and auto-completion text.

### Placeholder text
Placeholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter. Placeholder text should disappear after the user has entered data into the text field. Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as full sentences with punctuation. Examples are less likely to be written as full sentences with punctuation. 

<p class="caption">Example:</p>
<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/text-fields.png"/>
</div>

### Validation
Real time validation helps to streamline the process and keep data clean when the user is filling out data. Including helper or error text before, during, or after a user interacts with a text field can aid the user in making correct decisions.

<p class="caption">Example:</p>
<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/text-fields-validation.png"/>
</div>

## Mobile
Text fields on mobile should typically be stacked vertically, with labels and or hints above each field.

### Keyboard

- When the user touches an input field, a cursor is displayed and the keyboard is shown.
- Provide the keyboard thatâ€™s relevant to the data they are entering.
