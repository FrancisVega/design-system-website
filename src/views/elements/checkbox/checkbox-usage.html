### Title

If necessary, a title may accompany a set of checkboxes to provide further clarity into the selection the user is making.

### Labels

A checkbox should always be accompanied by a clear and concise label. Be explicit about the action that will follow if the checkbox is selected. Labels appear to the right of the checkbox.

### Click Target

Users should be able to select the checkbox by clicking on the box directly or by click on its label.

### Tables

See the <a href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/base-elements/tables.html" target="_blank">Tables</a> section for guidance on how to use checkboxes within a table.

### Default Selection

The default view of a set of checkboxes is having no option selected.
