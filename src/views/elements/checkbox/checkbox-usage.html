### Headings

If necessary, a heading can accompany a set of check boxes to provide further clarity for the user. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized). 

### Labels

Always use clear and concise labels for check boxes. Be explicit about the action that will follow if the checkbox is selected. Labels appear to the right of  checkboxes. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than 3 words.

### Click Target

Users should be able to select the checkbox by clicking on the box directly or by click on its label.

### Tables

See the <a href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/base-elements/tables.html" target="_blank">Tables</a> section for guidance on how to use checkboxes within a table.

### Default Selection

The default view of a set of checkboxes is having no option selected.
