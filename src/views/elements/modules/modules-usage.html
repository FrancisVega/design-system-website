## Structure

### Header

A header provides consistency and context to the module. Keep the text short and precise. Buttons or links may be used within a header and should always be right-aligned.

### Body

### Footer

A footer can be used for content or actions that need to be persistent throughout the module.

### Max Height

It is recommeded to design within the set height of a module. All content in a module needs to fit without internal scrolling.

### Max Width

Modules have a max width in order to structurally fit within the context of the UI.

## Empty States

In the case where a module has no data to display, an empty state must be shown that gives the user guidance on next steps. It is recommended to include an actionary item such as a button or a link that gives the user further direction.

<p class="caption">Example:</h5>
<div class="max30">
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/module-empty-state-02.png"/>

  <img src="/assets/images/usage/module-empty-state-03.png" />
</div>

## Overflow

If there is an overflow of content, use a &ldquo;view more&rdquo; link to redirect the user to a page with additional content.

<p class="caption">Example:</h5>
<div class="max30">
  <img src="/assets/images/usage/module-overflow.png" />
</div>
