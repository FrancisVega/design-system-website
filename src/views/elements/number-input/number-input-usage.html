## General guidelines
Number inputs should not be used when large value changes are expected. They work best for making small, incremental changes that only require a few clicks. The user may also chose to physically type in a number into the field.

## Labels
Number inputs should always be accompanied by a clear and concise label. Be explicit about the action that will follow if the checkbox is selected. Labels appear to the right of the checkbox.
