## General

Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include **Add, Save, Delete, Sign up.** Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links because it takes the user to a new page and is not associated with an action. Each page may have 1 to 2 primary buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action are represented as secondary buttons.

### Labels

Button labels tell users what will happen when they click the button. Use verbs that describe the action, such as **Add** or **Delete.** Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than 3 words for button labels.

For sets of buttons, use specific labels, such as **Save** or **Discard**, instead of using **OK** and **Cancel**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.

 For consistency, see <a class="base-link" href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/essentials/content-guide.html#glossary">Labels and idioms</a> for the approved list of action labels.

### Icon usage

- Use glyphs (16px) within buttons.
- Glyphs are distinguished by their solid shape and knocked-out details.
- Icons should always appear to the right of the text.
- Icons used in buttons must be directly related to the action that the user is taking.
- Icons must be the same color value as the text within a button.

## Copy button
The copy button is styled differently than other buttons because it serves a different purpose. It must be accompanied by a confirmation that states the successful action of copying an item to the users clipboard. The copy button uses the `copy-code` glyph.
