### Labels
Labels are essential to the usability of forms because they provide guidance to the data a user might provide. Do not place a label inside a select element. Use sentence case and no more than 3 words.

### Validation
Real time validation helps to streamline the process and keep data clean when the user is filling out data. For full guidelines, refer to the <a class="base-link" href="http://design-system.stage1.mybluemix.net/elements/forms.html#usage">Forms</a> usage tab.

</div>


### Order
The order of the select list should be based on the frequency of use. If applicable, the list should be in increasing order relative to the content. In cases of forms, alternative orders such as alphabetical may be more fitting. A horizontal rule can be used to group similar items together.

### Styling select dropdowns
It is strongly recommended not to style `select` dropdowns due to accessibility purposes.
One of the <a class="base-link" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G202.html" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 standards</a> for accessibility is &ldquo;Ensuring keyboard control for all functionality.&rdquo; CSS alternatives to <code>select</code> elements to not meet this requirement.
See below for examples on how a browser-specific <code>select</code> element renders differently:

<p class="caption">Chrome:</p>
<div>
<img src="/assets/images/usage/elements/select-2.png" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Firefox:</p>
<div>
<img src="/assets/images/usage/elements/select-3.png" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Safari:</p>
<div>
<img src="/assets/images/usage/elements/select-4.png" />
</div>

### Accessibility
The default <code>select</code> element is completely usable either with a mouse or a keyboard, following this process:
- Mouse: move your cursor over the <code>select</code> element
Keyboard: use the tab key to focus the <code>select</code> element
- Mouse: click on the <code>select</code> element
Keyboard: press enter
- Mouse: move your cursor over the desired option
Keyboard: use the top and bottom arrow keys to pick an option
- Mouse: click on the desired option
Keyboard: press enter

While you can make a CSS dropdown easily usable by a mouse, making it usable with keyboard navigation is complex.
