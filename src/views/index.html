  <p class="overview-section__main">Carbon in nature allows for complex structures to be made from simpler compounds. The Carbon Design System is a series of individual styles and components, that when combined make beautifully complex, natural, and intuitive designs. These designs are automatically systemic and logical, as they all follow the same universal principles. Carbon is constantly evolving and growing as we learn from our users, and most importantly, from you.</p>
