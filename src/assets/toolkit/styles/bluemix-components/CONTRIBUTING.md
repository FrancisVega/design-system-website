## Read These First

Please be sure to read the following guidelines from [our wiki](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/wiki):
* [Code of Conduct](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/wiki/Code-of-Conduct): *40 second read*
* [Code Styleguide](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/wiki/Code-Styleguide): *25 second read*
* [Git/GitHub FAQs](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/wiki/Git-and-GitHub-FAQ): *2 minute read*

## 1. Fork The Repo:

Go to [bluemix-components](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components) and click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.

![fork](https://uploads.github.ibm.com/github-enterprise-assets/0000/0076/0000/9136/2dbf657c-ca8e-11e5-9558-605d0e372cbd.png)

## 2. Clone Your Fork:

* Go to your GitHub profile.
* Find bluemix-components.
* Copy the **SSH clone URL**.

In your terminal:

```
git clone git@github.ibm.com:{YOUR_USERNAME}/bluemix-components.git
cd bluemix-components
```

See [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for more details.


## 3. Add Remotes

When you clone your personal repo, you will see `origin` is set up for you already by default. This should be pointing to your personal repo.

```
git remote add upstream git@github.ibm.com:Bluemix/bluemix-components.git
git remote add bthan git@github.ibm.com:bthan/bluemix-components.git

# List all your remotes
git remote -v
```

When you do `git remote -v`, you'll see these remotes:
* `origin`: connection to your fork
* `upstream`: connection to the original project.
* `bthan`: connection to [Brian Han's](https://github.ibm.com/bthan/bluemix-components) fork.


## 4. Work in a Branch

* Always work in a branch.
* Submit pull requests from a branch.
* *Do not submit pull requests from your forks master branch.*

```
git checkout -b {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}

# Edit some code
# Check status frequently to see what you're doing
git status

# Stage all of your changed files
git add .

# Write a short, descriptive message about the work you're committing
# Use keywords: "closes, fixes, resolves" and issue number to close the relevant issue
git commit -m "Update header with newest designs, resolves #123"
```

## 5. Test your JavaScript code

If you make any changes to our JavaScript code, test your change by:

```sh
> gulp test
```

If you add any features to our JavaScript code, make sure adding test so that your code is covered.
Tests are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)/[Chai](http://chaijs.com).
You can see if your code is covered by looking at bluemix-components/tests/coverage/\*/index.html after running test.

If your change may hit some browser quirks, use `-b` option, like:

```sh
> gulp test -b IE
```

Other options for testing are:

* `-d`/`--debug`: Stop generating code coverage report. Useful to debug your code when running test.
* `-k`/`--keepalive`: Keep running test runner even after test ends. Test will restart running when you make changes to any test files or any files under test.

## 6. Make a Pull Request

**Note:** Before you make a pull request, [search](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/issues) the issues to see if a similar issue has already been submitted. If a similar issue has been submitted, assign yourself or ask to be assigned to the issue by posting a comment. If the issue does not exist, create a new issue.  

When you're at a good stopping place and you're ready for feedback from other contributors and maintainers, **push your commits to your fork**:

```
git push origin {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
```

In your browser, navigate to [Bluemix/bluemix-components](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components) and click the button that reads "Compare & pull request"
