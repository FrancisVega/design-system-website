# Templates

Explore these folders to get a sense of how you would assemble a page using the bluemix-components library. Included are a barebones setup of gulp + webpack - to open in development mode, run `npm install` in the `templates folder`, and then `gulp serve` inside each folder (this assumes gulp installed globally).

Alternatively, to simply view the layouts, open the `index.html` file inside the `dist` folder.
