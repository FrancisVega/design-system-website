## Components

### Dropdown
We're excited to bring some added functionality that enchances our [Dropdown](/components/dropdown) component. Filtering, Multiselect, and Inline Dropdown are new additions to our basic Dropdown component.

**Note: This component is currently only available in [React](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?selectedKind=ComboBox&selectedStory=default&full=0&addons=1&stories=1&panelRight=0&addonPanel=storybook%2Factions%2Factions-panel).**

### Small Toggle
Small Toggle is a style variation of our traditional [Toggle](/components/toggle) component. It's more compact in size, which allows them to be used in Data Tables or inline with Form elements.
