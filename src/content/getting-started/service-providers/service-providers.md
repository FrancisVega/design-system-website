## Using Carbon

We encourage service teams to utilize the Carbon Design System for visual styles and user experience guidance. By utilizing the [Carbon Component Library](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components), your development teams can easily implement our ready-made components and elements to create a comprehensive UI.

In order to onboard your service into Bluemix, there are 3 stages your service must go through before launching to GA. Design approval is required prior to an Experimental, Beta, or GA launch.

## Experimental & Pre-Beta

### Design Requirements for Experimental & Pre-Beta

#### Catalog Service Icon

The catalog service icon is an opportunity for you to create or utilize an icon or logo that illustrates your service. All icons should follow the Catalog Service Icon Guidelines at the bottom of this page. Before submitting, your icon will need to be approved by your offerings design team and IBM legal team.

#### Service Dashboard

Service Dashboards are used for showing information and details of an instance that exists. Use the service dashboard templates in the [Carbon Design Kit](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit) as a starting point and foundation for your design.

#### Service Configuration Pages

Configuration pages appear when a user has clicked on a category or service from the Bluemix catalog. Use the service configuration templates in the [Carbon Design Kit](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit) as a starting point and foundation for your design.

When you have met the above requirements, schedule a playback with your design director to go over your work and gain approval.

## Beta

Welcome to Beta, where the bulk of the work happens to make your service better than ever.

### Design Requirements for Beta

#### Net Promoter Score

Bluemix uses Net Promoter Score (NPS) to track user feedback. The NPS question, “How likely are you to recommend this service to a friend or coworker?” will be presented to users in the product on their third use of your service. Users answer on a scale from 0-10, and will have the opportunity to provide additional feedback through a follow-up response. Services should achieve and maintain a minimum NPS of 26 from a minimum of 25 non-IBM users. Use the user feedback to inform design decisions and make appropriate changes.

#### User Testing

User testing is an important part of the Beta process, as it can help you find problems within your design. Refer to the user testing worksheet to help you conduct these tests. You must complete five User Tests while your service is in Beta.

#### Playback

At its core, a Playback is a presentation. Plan to communicate the current state of your work and any plans moving forward.

## GA

**Net Promoter Score:** You must maintain an NPS of 26 or your service will be under review. There will be a six month post-GA check-in to look at your score and discuss user feedback.

## Catalog Service Icon Guidelines

You offering team has complete control over your icons design. We recommend that all icons try and feel like IBM Design or reflect your product portfolios style.

Only one SVG is required for your service icon. It should be submitted at the dimensions of 32px x 32px. In the product, service icons only appear at the below four sizes. These size changes will be done in code and no longer require multiple assets.

_Borders are used here to show total dimensions; icons should not include a border when submitted._

If you have multiple services, you should either use the same icon with a different color for each service or use the same color scheme for each distinct icon. The examples here show how a row of services from the same provider could look in the catalog.

### Color

We recommend you use 1-4 colors max in your catalog icon. Use color combinations that work well together. Avoid using too may colors, a gray-scale palette, and colors with too little contrast. Refer to the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/resources/color-library/) color palette for color inspiration and accessibility guidelines.

### Best Practices

**Do:**

* Get creative
* Be symmetrical
* Use a bold line weight/stroke
* Use two similar colors to create depth and value
* Make your icon pixel perfect and aligned to the pixel grid
* Draw vectors to whole pixels
* Expand all strokes

**Don't:**

* Gradients
* Drop shadows
* Use more than 2px line weight/stroke
* Use a color background
* Use decimals in x and y coordinates or width and height fields.

### Icon Approval

Make sure your Service Icon meets Bluemix's Catalog Service Icon Guidelines, then submit your services SVG to the [Service Icon repository](https://github.ibm.com/bthan/service-icons-temp) via an issue for approval.

For help on exporting SVGs refer to the [Carbon Iconography Guidelines](http://carbondesignsystem.com/style/iconography/contribution)
