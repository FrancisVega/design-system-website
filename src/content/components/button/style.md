| Regular buttons | 40 | 2.5 |

### Spacing
A Button cannot have any element or text within 16 pixels / 1 rem of its borders. For Button groups, the primary button is positioned on the outside of the set, while the secondary button is positioned inside. For a Button with an icon, the space between the button label and the icon must be greater than or equal to 16 pixels / 1 rem. This is to accommodate for instances where two or more buttons with icons appear together.


| SPACING                 | PX | REM   |
|-------------------------|----|-------|
| Text & button           | 16 | 1     |
| Regular button external | 16 | 1     |
| Small button external   | 10 | 0.625 |
| Button pairings         | 16 | 1     |
| Button & icon           | 16 | 1     |
