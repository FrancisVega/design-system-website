## General guidelines

Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include **Add**, **Save**, **Delete**, **Sign up**. Do not use Buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use [Links](/components/link) because it takes the user to a new page and is not associated with an action. Each page may have one to two primary buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action are represented as secondary buttons.

## Usage

| Button type      | Purpose                                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary          | For the principle call to action on the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Secondary        | For secondary actions on each page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Button with icon | When words are not enough, icons can be used in buttons to better communicate what the button does. Icons are always paired with text.                                                                                                                           |
| Disabled button  | Use when the user cannot proceed until an input is collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Set of Buttons   | When an action required by the user has more than one option, always use a positive action button (primary) paired with a negative action button (secondary). Positive action buttons should be on the right, while negative action buttons will be on the left. |
| Small Button     | Use when there is not enough vertical space for a regular sized button.           

## Labels

Button labels tell users what will happen when they click the button. Use verbs that describe the action, such as **Add** or **Delete**. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels.

For Sets of Buttons, use specific labels, such as **Save** or **Discard**, instead of using **OK** and **Cancel**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.

For consistency, see [labels and idioms](/guidelines/content/glossary) for the approved list of action labels.

## Icon usage

* Use glyphs (16px) within buttons.
* Glyphs are distinguished by their solid shape and knocked-out details.
* Icons should always appear to the right of the text.
* Icons used in buttons must be directly related to the action that the user is taking.
* Icons must be the same color value as the text within a button.
