Sliders let users select from a range of values by moving an element across a horizontal track. 


## General guidelines
Sliders provide a visual indication of adjustable content, where as the user can move an element along a horizontal track to increase or decrease the value. 

Users can choose the numerical value by:

* Entering the exact value into the text field
* Using the slider, in which the text field value will automatically update.

## Best practices
* Don't use for ranges that are extremely large.
* Don't use for ranges that are too small (1-3).
* The slider label should describe specifically what the value the slider is changing. 
* Secondary text can be used to describe the range of values.
